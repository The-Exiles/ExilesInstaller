# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We generally support the latest released version of ExilesInstaller. Security fixes will be prioritized for the most recent version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not create public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Preferred private reporting methods:

1) GitHub Security Advisories (private)
- Go to the repository's Security tab → Advisories → "Report a vulnerability"
- This creates a private discussion with the maintainers

2) Email (if needed)
- If Security Advisories are unavailable to you, contact the repository owner via the email listed on their GitHub profile and include "SECURITY" in the subject.

What to include:
- Affected versions (and how you installed ExilesInstaller)
- Environment (Windows version/build)
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Impact assessment (what could an attacker do?)
- Any potential mitigations

We will acknowledge your report, investigate promptly, and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline. If the issue affects an ecosystem dependency, we may work with upstream projects as appropriate.

## PGP/Signing
Releases may include checksums in `artifacts/` (e.g., `SHA256SUMS.txt`). Verify downloads using these checksums when available.
