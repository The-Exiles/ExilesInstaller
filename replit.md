# Exiles Installer - COMPLETED

## Overview

Exiles Installer is a comprehensive desktop application for the Elite Dangerous gaming community that automates the installation of third-party tools, utilities, and hardware drivers. Built with Python and Tkinter, it provides a centralized solution for installing the entire Elite Dangerous ecosystem including market connectors, exploration tools, voice response systems, joystick software, head tracking applications, and various hardware manufacturer utilities.

**PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETE** - The application is fully functional with dark spaceship HUD interface, comprehensive installation handlers, streaming downloads with checksum validation, and complete PyInstaller packaging. Ready for Windows deployment.

The installer features a modern GUI with Elite Dangerous theming, supports multiple installation methods (GitHub releases, direct downloads, Windows package managers), and includes automated post-installation configuration steps. It's designed to streamline the complex process of setting up the numerous tools that enhance the Elite Dangerous gaming experience.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Application Structure
The application follows a monolithic desktop architecture built with Python's Tkinter framework. The main application (`main.py`) contains a single `ExilesInstaller` class that handles all GUI interactions, installation logic, and user interface management. This design choice prioritizes simplicity and ease of maintenance over modularity, making it suitable for a specialized installer application.

### Configuration Management
The application uses a JSON-based configuration system (`apps.json`) that defines all available applications and their installation parameters. This approach allows for easy modification of the application catalog without code changes. Each application entry includes metadata such as installation type, source URLs, optional flags, and post-installation scripts.

### Installation Methods
The installer supports multiple installation strategies to accommodate different software distribution models:
- GitHub releases (downloading specific assets from repository releases)
- Direct executable downloads from URLs
- Windows package managers (Winget, Chocolatey)
- Archive extraction with custom post-processing scripts
This flexible approach handles the diverse distribution methods used by Elite Dangerous community tools.

### User Interface Design
The GUI implements an Elite Dangerous-inspired dark theme with orange and blue accent colors. The interface uses a checkbox-based selection system for optional applications and provides real-time progress feedback during installations. The design prioritizes clarity and ease of use for users who may not be technically experienced.

### Build and Distribution
The application uses PyInstaller to create standalone executables, bundling all dependencies and the configuration file into a single distributable file. This approach eliminates dependency management issues for end users and ensures consistent behavior across different Windows environments.

### Error Handling and Logging
The application implements comprehensive logging to both file and console outputs, enabling troubleshooting of installation issues. Error handling focuses on graceful degradation, allowing partial installations to succeed even if individual components fail.
