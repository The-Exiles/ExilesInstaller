## About ICARUS Terminal

[Permalink: About ICARUS Terminal](https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus#about-icarus-terminal)

_ICARUS Terminal is a free, immersive, context-sensitive companion app and second screen interface for [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/)._

You can run ICARUS Terminal in a native window, on multiple windows/displays, as an overlayed window in top of the game if playing with a VR headset or on an ultra-wide display or connect remotely in a browser from another computer/tablet/phone/other devices (e.g. Chromebook, Android Phone/Tablet, Amazon Fire Tablet); the UI is specifically designed with touch screen devices in mind and to adapt the layout of panels to both landscape and portrait displays, both large and small.

## Requirements

[Permalink: Requirements](https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus#requirements)

The self-contained installer is around 20 MB and has no dependancies. If you are running an older but supported release of Windows, any missing dependancies will be automatically installed.

- Windows 10 or newer required.
- No dependancies are required to install the application.
- No manual configuration or setup is required, it will automatically find your game data.
- No additional diskspace is required to store game data. Recent game data is loaded in to memory when launched and streamed in real time when the game is active, it is not persisted or cached to disk.

### Notes

[Permalink: Notes](https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus#notes)

- This software is in early access. All releases are pre-releases and contain known defects.
- The launcher will indicate when a new release is available. Updating is optional.
- All releases are code signed and verified. If you have a conflict with your anti-virus or firewall software, please contact the vendor responsible for that software.
- The application will run against the latest version of Elite Dangerous (Odyssey) and older releases (e.g. Horizons), but it is currently explicitly designed for use with the latest versions. Changes to the game API may impact functionality when using ICARUS Terminal with older versions of the game.
- The application includes a web interface to allow access from remote devices. The web interface is enabled by default while the application is running.

The web interface relies on advanced browser functionality for rendering and works best on native Google Chrome browsers (e.g. Google Chrome for Windows, Mac, ChromeOS, Android). Other browsers (e.g. Safari, Firefox, Chromium) may use fallback rendering and/or lack required features for full compatbility / optimal user experience.

## Developer Documentation

[Permalink: Developer Documentation](https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus#developer-documentation)

Code contributions, pull requests and bug reports are not currently being accepted for this repository. See [CONTRIB.md](https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus/blob/main/CONTRIB.md) for more information. For developer documentation see [BUILD.md](https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus/blob/main/BUILD.md).

### Developer Quickstart

[Permalink: Developer Quickstart](https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus#developer-quickstart)

If you are running on Linux and/or looking for quick instructions on how to run from source, if you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) this is what you need to do to download and install ICARUS Terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:iaincollins/icarus.git
cd icarus
npm install

```

Next, run `cp .env-example .env` to create an `.env` file and edit it to change the `LOG_DIR` option to point to the location of your Elite Dangerous log files:

```
# LOG_DIR can be used to tell the Service where to look for game logs
# This option can be used in development and at runtime
LOG_DIR=path/to/logs

```

With that done, anytime you want to start ICARUS Terminal, all you need to do is run:

```
npm start

```

This will run in debug mode which is not quite the same as a production build (it's not as optimised) but should work just fine.

## Support

[Permalink: Support](https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus#support)

People have asked if I take donations for the project - I don't donations, but
I do appreciate the offer.

If you want to support development of ICARUS Terminal, the best way is to visit
the [Ardent Pioneer (V9G-G7Z)](https://inara.cz/elite/station/490914/).

Selling Tritium to the carrier directly supports development as it means I can
spend more time adding features to ICARUS Terminal and travelling the galaxy to
test them out!

You can use Inara to [find out which system the Ardent Pioneer is currently in](https://inara.cz/elite/station/490914/) and see if it's anywhere near you.

Before you visit you might want to [check out what commodities are currently\\
being traded](https://inara.cz/elite/station-market/490914/). You might also
want to chat to the bartender to see what they are looking for!
